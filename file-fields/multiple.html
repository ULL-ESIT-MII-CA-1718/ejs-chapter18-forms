   The <tt>files</tt> property of a file field element is an array-like
    object (again, not a real array) containing the files chosen
    in the field. <br/>
    It is initially empty. The reason there isn’t
    simply a file property is that file fields also support a
    <tt>multiple</tt> attribute, which makes it possible to select multiple
    files at the same time.

             Objects in the files property have properties such as

               size (the file’s size in bytes), and 
               type (the media type of the file, such as text/plain or image/jpeg).
