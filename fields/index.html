      <!-- 
        The name attribute of a form field determines the way its value
        will be identified when the form is submitted. 
      -->
      <p>Password: <input type="password" value="123" name="password"> (password input)</p>

      <p>
          The <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> tag is used to associate a piece of
          text with an input field. <br/>
          Its <b>for</b> attribute should refer to the id of the field. <br/>
          Clicking the label will activate
          the field, which focuses it and toggles its value when
          it is a checkbox or radio button.<br/>
          <label for="cb">
            Will attend:
            <input type="checkbox" name="attend" id="cb" checked> (checkbox)
          </label>
      </p>

      <p>
        A radio button is similar to a checkbox, but it’s implicitly linked
        to other radio buttons with the same name attribute so that only
        one of them can be active at any time.
      </p>
      <p>Your choice: 
         <input type="radio" value="lightgreen" name="choice"> Green
         <input type="radio" value="lightblue" name="choice"> Blue
         <input type="radio" value="" name="choice" checked> White (example of input radio)</p>
      <p><input type="file"file> (file)</p>

      <p>Description (test: select a word inside the textarea and press F2. See what happens):<br/>
        <textarea name="description" rows=4 cols="50">
          one
          two
          three
        </textarea>
      </p>

      <p>
      The size attribute to the <b>&lt;select&gt;</b> tag is used to set the
        number of options that are visible at the same time, which
        gives you explicit control over the drop-down’s appearance.
        For example, setting the size attribute to "3" will make
        the field show three lines, whether it has the multiple
        option enabled or not.
      </p>
      <p> Your desserts:</br>
        <select multiple name="desserts" size="2">
          <option>Pancakes</option>
          <option>Pudding</option>
          <option>Ice cream</option>
          <option>Orange</option>
        </select>
